The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior when styles are overridden.  For example, consider the following scenario:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green;
}
```

If an element has both `#myElement` and `.myClass` selectors applied, the `#myElement.myClass` selector will be the most specific and the element's color will be green. However, if there are additional classes or inline styles applied, the specificity might change unexpectedly.
