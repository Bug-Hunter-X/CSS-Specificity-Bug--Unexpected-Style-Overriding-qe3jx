# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in CSS: unexpected behavior arising from the specificity rules when multiple selectors interact.

## Problem Description

The `bug.css` file contains CSS rules that showcase how specificity can lead to unexpected style overriding.  The intended behavior might not be achieved due to the complex interplay of ID, class, and element selectors. The problem is further detailed in the `bugContent` section of the JSON description.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file provides a fix by carefully adjusting the CSS specificity to ensure styles are applied as expected.  The solution prioritizes the most relevant styles.  The solution approach is explained in the `solutionContent` of the JSON description.  The solution prioritizes using more specific selectors or employing the `!important` declaration when absolutely necessary (although `!important` should be used sparingly).
